## Lesson 1 Blockchain Basics

### Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

-   Bitcoin just store value
-   Ethereum is a platform not just to store value but also decentralized agreements.

### Oracles

chainlink, band protocol, etc.

-   They are the bridge between the blockchain and the real world.
-   They are the ones that provide the data to the blockchain.
-   Off-chain data to on-chain data.

### Hybrid Smart Contracts

On-chain + Off-chain Agreements

### There are many blockchain platforms

Such as Polkadot, Solana, etc.

Most of them are EVM compatible.

### Dapp

Dapp = Decentralized application

Decentralized Protocol = Smart Contract

### Web3

Web1, Web2, and Web3 represent different generations of the internet.

-   **Web1.0**: This is the first generation of the internet, also known as the "read-only" web. It was primarily static, meaning users could only view the content and not interact with it or contribute their own. Websites were mainly informational.

-   **Web2.0**: This is the current version of the internet, also known as the "read-write" web. It is interactive and social, allowing users to create and share content. Examples include social media platforms, blogs, wikis, and video sharing platforms. However, a significant drawback is that personal data is often controlled by large corporations.
    **(Run agreements on companies servers)**

-   **Web3.0**: This is the future generation of the internet, also known as the "read-write-execute" web. It aims to create a decentralized internet where users have control over their own data. It leverages blockchain technology and decentralized networks to achieve this. Web3.0 enables direct peer-to-peer interactions, with smart contracts automating agreements and transactions. Decentralized applications (DApps) are a key part of Web3.0.

### What is the value of Smart Contracts?

-   Trust minimized agreements
-   Promises unbreakable

### The purpose of Smart Contracts

In real world:
Agreements/Contracts = Promises

Smart Contracts:
Immutable = Unbreakable
Decentralized = Trust minimized
Transparent = Verifiable
